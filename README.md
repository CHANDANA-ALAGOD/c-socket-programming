TCP and UDP Client-Server Communication in C

This project demonstrates how I implemented basic client-server communication using both TCP and UDP sockets in C on Linux.
It also includes packet captures analyzed with tcpdump and Wireshark to explore how these protocols behave in practice.
System Setup

    Laptop: Dell Vostro 3400

    Operating System: Ubuntu Linux

    Network: Loopback interface (localhost - 127.0.0.1) used for local testing

How to Compile
Compile TCP Programs

gcc client.c -o client
gcc server.c -o server

Compile UDP Programs

gcc client1.c -o client1
gcc server1.c -o server1

How to Run
Running TCP Client and Server

In one terminal window:

./server

In another terminal window:

./client

Running UDP Client and Server

In one terminal window:

./server1

In another terminal window:

./client1

Packet Capture

While running the client-server programs, I captured network traffic to analyze protocol behavior.
Using tcpdump

Example command (TCP):

sudo tcpdump -i lo -w tcpdump_tcp.pcap

Using Wireshark

Captured packet traces saved as .pcap files.
Observed key differences in behavior between TCP (connection-oriented, reliable delivery) and UDP (connectionless, faster, no retransmission).
Key Learnings

    Implemented both TCP and UDP client-server programs in C

    Understood connection setup and teardown (TCP 3-way handshake vs UDPâ€™s stateless behavior)

    Analyzed packet flow and headers using tcpdump and Wireshark

    Observed packet retransmissions, flow control in TCP, and lack thereof in UDP

Conclusion

This project helped me develop a practical understanding of:

    The differences between TCP and UDP protocols

    How socket programming works in C

    How to capture and analyze network traffic on Linux

It lays the groundwork for future projects involving more advanced networking and protocol analysis.
